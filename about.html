    <p><strong><a href="Distributed Transaction System">Distributed Transaction System</a></strong> </br>
        • Worked in a team of two to implement a distributed transaction system, which could be used in a lot of distributed products such as databases and GSuites. Supports transactions that read and write to distributed objects, like setting and getting values of some variable by a lot of clients at the same time. Ensures atomicity, consistency and isolation.  

        • Enabled clients to execute transactions concurrently. Guaranteed serializability with strict two Phase Locking. Supports COMMIT and ABORT during every period of a transaction. Supports deadlock detection by maintaining a wait-for graph  

     <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/University-Course-Information-System">Django Development: University Course Information System</a></strong> </br>
        • Developed a university course management system with Python, HTML/CSS and SQLite, which supports four user roles, system admin, registrar, scheduler and clerk. Enable users to manage course information, such as creating, reading, updating and deleting records for courses and course selections. Measured risk of different operations and reminded users of high risky operations.   

        • Designed and Implemented the UI of the system with HTML/CSS. Used Django to develop a server to handle requests and send back responses. Utilized SQLite database as backend storage.
        
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/mini-Cryptocurrency-System">Mini Cryptocurrency System</a></strong> </br>
        • Implemented a decentralized cryptocurrency system which secure financial transactions and ensures Nakamoto consensus with its longest chain rule using Go.   

        • Used Gossip protocol to distribute transaction information to all of the nodes. Sent out transaction messages asynchronously among the system. Ensured dynamic membership of nodes with new nodes joining and old nodes leaving.  

        • Created a simple logging system which could be used to evaluate the health of the cryptocurrency system, like to verify that a transaction reaches all nodes in the system, to track the propagation speed of a transaction and to track the bandwidth used by the system. Guaranteed to achieve eventually consistency by preserving the longest chain rule. Used SHA256 algorithm to serialize data. 

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/Distributed-Chat-System">Distributed Group Chat System</a></strong> </br>
        • Created a distributed group chat system which enables multiple users to chat over network using Go.  

        • Supported fault tolerance by simulating heartbeat protocol with the help of TCP/IP. Displayed a message when a node fails while others could continue chatting.
        
        • Implemented multicasting so that a message is sent to all connections in the connection pool. Ensured causally ordered delivery of messages by implementing vector timestamp protocol.       

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/FindYourSong">Android Development: Spotify-based Music Recommendation System</a></strong> </br>
    • Cooperated with 3 students to implement a Spotify-base music recommendation system, which suggests songs when users login with their Spotify accounts. Constructed a SQL database to store data. Created a server in PHP to receive requests, connect to database, construct and send back responses. Built an Android application as front end.</br>
    • Developed a server in PHP which supports several APIs including following users’ friends, recommending songs, searching for track, album, artist.</br>
    • Utilized Java Android to implement front end. Implemented login function with Spotify Auth. Programmed UI of the application such as designing a progress bar to show similarities of musical tastes between users and their friends.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/Yelp-Data-Visualization">
    Website for Data Visualization</a></strong> </br>
    • Developed a web application that realized a visualization of Yelp academic dataset with size 7G using Python, MySQL, PHP, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Worked on the dataset to find some interesting information and present them in different statistical graphs such as scattered plot and multiline chart.</br>
    • Used Python to preprocess the JSON data and save to a MySQL database. Wrote a PHP server to retrieve needed data from database for front end. Deployed the server on CPanel, which is a web host manager.</br>
    • Built the framework of the website with Bootstrap template. Sent requests and received responses from server in AJAX. Applied a JavaScript package called D3 to display data in different forms including an interactive world map which can show data corresponding to different places when users hover over.</p>


    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/PlantManagementSystem.git">Factory Management System</a></strong> </br>
    • Worked in a group of four to implement a local factory management system, which supports three user roles, salesmen, managers and warehouse keeper for a factory in SQL and Java. Provided different functions according to user roles such as allowing salesmen to check stock and record new purchases but forbid them from updating storage data.</br>
    • Utilized Java Swing to create user interface, which mainly consists of three parts: login page, main page that displays a list of goods, and popups for users’ operations. Validate user login by matching username and password with those in the database. Prevent maloperations such as sending a warning when users entered a wrong password. Implemented publish–subscribe model by objects like ButtonClickEvent.</p>
