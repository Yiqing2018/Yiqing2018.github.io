    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/FindYourSong">Android Development: Spotify-based Music Recommendation System</a></strong> </br>
    • Cooperated with 3 students to implement a Spotify-base music recommendation system, which suggests songs when users login with their Spotify accounts. Constructed a SQL database to store data. Created a server in PHP to receive requests, connect to database, construct and send back responses. Built an Android application as front end.</br>
    • Developed a server in PHP which supports several APIs including following users’ friends, recommending songs, searching for track, album, artist.</br>
    • Utilized Java Android to implement front end. Implemented login function with Spotify Auth. Programmed UI of the application such as designing a progress bar to show similarities of musical tastes between users and their friends.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/Yelp-Data-Visualization">
    Website for Data Visualization</a></strong> </br>
    • Developed a web application that realized a visualization of Yelp academic dataset with size 7G using Python, MySQL, PHP, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Worked on the dataset to find some interesting information and present them in different statistical graphs such as scattered plot and multiline chart.</br>
    • Used Python to preprocess the JSON data and save to a MySQL database. Wrote a PHP server to retrieve needed data from database for front end. Deployed the server on CPanel, which is a web host manager.</br>
    • Built the framework of the website with Bootstrap template. Sent requests and received responses from server in AJAX. Applied a JavaScript package called D3 to display data in different forms including an interactive world map which can show data corresponding to different places when users hover over.</p>


    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Yiqing2018/PlantManagementSystem.git">Factory Management System</a></strong> </br>
    • Worked in a group of four to implement a local factory management system, which supports three user roles, salesmen, managers and warehouse keeper for a factory in SQL and Java. Provided different functions according to user roles such as allowing salesmen to check stock and record new purchases but forbid them from updating storage data.</br>
    • Utilized Java Swing to create user interface, which mainly consists of three parts: login page, main page that displays a list of goods, and popups for users’ operations. Validate user login by matching username and password with those in the database. Prevent maloperations such as sending a warning when users entered a wrong password. Implemented publish–subscribe model by objects like ButtonClickEvent.</p>
